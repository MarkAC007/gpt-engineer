1. File select fuctionally to load files to be compared.
2. Submit button
3. Console window that show progress, and can interact with the user. For example, ask the user what columns they would like to be compared between CSV files.
4. Ask the user which columns to compare from the loaded csv files.  More than one column can be selected.
5. The Column ID should be used as the main key to compare each record.
6. the site needs to have a clean look and feel, with a place holder for a logo.
7. after the compare has completed, the user should be able to interact with the results by sorting and filtering.
8. the results should be exportable in the format of CSV, PDF, or word.
